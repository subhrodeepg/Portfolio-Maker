# Portfolio Maker 

## Project by Subhrodeep Ghose

The application will allow users to add stocks using their ticker symbol to a portfolio, and monitor the performance of 
portfolio over time. Users can have multiple portfolios; the application will allow the user to compare the performance 
of different portfolios. The target demographic for this application are individuals who are interested in monitoring
stock performance over time; such as:
- casual investors
- individuals interested in monitoring a certain sector

I choose this project because I am interested in financial technologies, and I am an amateur investor.
